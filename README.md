# Real Time Pose Detection and Correctness Model
The project involves creating a Pose Detection and Correction Model using Mediapipe, a powerful library for building real-time perception models. The model is capable of detecting human poses in images and analyzing the detected keypoints to identify potential misalignments. The primary objective is to assist users by providing feedback on their posture, making it ideal for applications in fitness, physical therapy, and ergonomic assessments.

# Programming Language: Python
# Libraries and Tools: Mediapipe, OpenCV
# Jupyter Notebook
